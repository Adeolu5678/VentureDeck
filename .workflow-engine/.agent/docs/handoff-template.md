## 📝 Usage Notes

### When to Create a Handoff

Create a handoff when:
- ✅ Pausing work before task completion
- ✅ Significant progress made but more remains
- ✅ Hitting complexity that needs fresh perspective
- ✅ Context/memory is getting heavy
- ✅ Encountering blockers that need resolution

### Quality Checklist

Before saving, verify:
- [ ] Summary is clear and concise
- [ ] All modified files are listed
- [ ] Remaining work is actionable
- [ ] Context includes key decisions
- [ ] Next steps are specific
- [ ] A new agent could continue without asking questions

### Naming Convention

```
.agent/handoffs/TASK-XXX-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
```

Example: `TASK-005-2024-01-15-1430.md`

Multiple handoffs for same task are fine (shows progression).
